## Introduction
This is a Power Bi Project of the Production Analysis of a **Manufacturing Company**
The Project is to analyze and derive insights to answer crucial questions and make 
the company make data driven decision

_Disclaimer_ : _Datasets from the Mircosoft Adevtureworks database. Used to demomstrate my learnings and capabilities
with Proving Data Driven Decisions woth power BI_

# Objecive:
To provide insights into production performance by various categories and time periods

# Problem Statement
1. What Product categories contributed to the highest production performance
2.  What time period did the highest production performance occur?

# Skills and Concepts demonstrated:
The following Power BI features were incorporated
- Getting data from the server (Microsoft based)
- Modelling relationships with tables
- DAX and Calculated Measure
- Page Navigation and Button

**Modelling**
Automatic derived relationships were used. Data cleaning done to remove unwanted columns, duplicates
One Dimemsion table and Five Fact tables detected. One to many relationships
